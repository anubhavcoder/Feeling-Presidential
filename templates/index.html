				<h2>About</h2>
				<!-- <p>This d3 force layout represents the most common two-word phrases in this sampling of presidential speeches. Each phrase is tied to the speech it is from, which is in turn tied to the President who gave the speech.</p>
				<p>Sentiment was done on the phrases shown here if they appeared more than three times in a single speech. Supervised machine learning was performed on a relatively small data set of politically speeches; using this data as a primary source for any research is not recommended.</p> -->
